This project showcases an autonomous package handling robot using Raspberry Pi, three unreleased antennas made by a company which I cannot disclose, a ultrasonic sensor, a pressure sensor, etc. The robot autonomously navigates from a docking station to a users station, all while securely carrying a package. Upon arrival, it drops off the package at the user station and returns back to the docking station. This is all done while constantly using the antennas for communication and guidance. One antenna is situated at the docking station, another is positioned at the user station, and the third is integrated into the robot. 

The code represents the software logic governing this robot by running on a Raspberry PI with connected GPIO pins controlling the motors and sensors. The code works by initializing and setting up everything at the beginning, then defining all the necessary functions, and finally, using multithreading to incorporate all the functions together at once so that the robot is autonomously the full trip.

To run the code, all you need is the finalscript.py file: you may run the file using the run button or you can type the following into your terminal: python finalscript.py
